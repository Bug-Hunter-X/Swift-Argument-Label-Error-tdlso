# Swift Argument Label Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: forgetting to include argument labels when calling a function.

The `bug.swift` file shows the incorrect usage, leading to a compiler error.  The `bugSolution.swift` file shows the correct usage, including argument labels. 

This is a helpful example for understanding the importance of argument labels in Swift function calls and how to avoid this common mistake.
